## RAP-BTL Examples

The examples in this directory have been compiled using GNU C++, LLVM Clang and 
Visual C++.  If you have the make utility available, the command 'make targets' 
will list on screen, all of the examples which the Makefile can build.  
Otherwise most of the examples, except eloper.c and interloper.cpp which 
correspond to the 'elope' make target, are single file compilation units.
